Commands for running the program:
    cd aidana_maze
    python last2.py maze.txt spreading_rate decay_rate

File last.py contains code for generating the maze and writing it to the txt file 'maze'.
While last2.py contains code for loading inputs from the txt file and calculating smell and wind.

As I tested, smell and wind values are calculated correctly.
I lacked time for reading parameters so for now the calculations cannot be seen.

However, it can be tested by printing them to the console.
For this please  run:
python ./last.py
